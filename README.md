# DroneSwarm
Repository for project called "Self-synchronized drones' network" for Embedded AI course @ UCU

You are able to launch different types of drones using ```*_launcher.py``` files by including the ip address of demonstration PC.

You would also need the unity set up with drone entities created with .cs scripts for each of them in ```unity/``` directory.
